          <h1>What do I consider futuristic technology?</h1>
          
          <p>I consider futuristic technology to be incredible developments in technology, which either
          change society in monumental ways or begin<br>a complete rethink of our technology today</p>
          
          
          <h2>Necrobiotics</h2>

      <p>Necrobiotics means turning dead things into robots, which is almost as
          disgusting as it sounds. A team of researchers at Rice University recently<br>managed to turn a dead
          spider into a robot-like gripper. They did this by injecting air into the spider, since they
          use their blood in a system much<br>more similar to pneumatics than our muscles.</p>

      <h2 class="rightSideP">AI image generation</h2>
          
      <p>AI has advanced rapidly in recent years, and is revolutionizing many diferent industries, from
      chess to text generation, and, more recently, art.<br>Software such as DALL-E are able to create
      completely origional artworks form simple (or silly) text prompts, such as "a brown dog in a coat in<br>
      Morissons eating cake".</p>
